    <h1>BREATH</h1>
    <p>In BREATH, Félix Guattari speaks of “chaosmosis”: the process of rebalancing the osmosis between the mind and chaos. Hölderlin speaks of poetry as linguistic vibration, oscillation, and quest, of a rhythm tuned to the chaosmotic evolution that simultaneously involves mind and world. He elaborates on chaos and order and their relationship as they have a symbiotic relationship - one cannot exist without the other, as they both exist because of each other. This reading was similar to the 422 readings where how you can unsterstand/see information or in this case, “code.” Through the reading we learn that poetics points at language and expands it and the signifier =/= signified.</p>

    <h1>The Black Stack</h1>
    <p>In The Black Stack, we are introduced to the Stack. There are six layers to this Stack: Earth, Cloud, City, Address, Interface, and User. The Black Stack, then, is to the Stack what the shadow of the future is to the form of the present, comprised of “noncontiguous geographies.” Bratton explains that “over the course of modernization, more was added to the intricate bargains of Leviathan: energy, infrastructure, legal identity and standing, objective and comprehensive maps, credible currencies, and flag-brand loyalties. ”

    <h1>In Free Fall</h1>
    <p>Hito Steyerl’s “In Free Fall: A Thought Experiment on Vertical Perspective,” he touches on the concept of falling and the downfall of a ‘linear’ perspective and its relationship to the politics of verticality. Hito writes that ‘falling is relational,’ if theres is no ground or anything to halt the fall, you are essentially floating and it feels like ‘perfect stasis.’ Within the reading, the concept of spatial and temporal orientation are explored as the horizontal line is explained to be the basis of time and location measurement. Linear perspective is based on the use of the horizon that seafarers a sense of orientation which ultimately became a tool to construct optical paradigms. The vertical perspective, challenges the linear by means of removing boundaries that would be overhead or below, and defies the conventional perception of time. The vertical implies a new certainty can be taken into account as it teaches us to consider the social and political injustices that exist as our societies and medias do not function linearly.</p>

    <h1>#ACCELERATE MANIFESTO</h1>
    <p>In “#ACCELERATE - MANIFESTO FOR AN ACCELERATIONIST POLITICS,” the decline of human interaction with government politics becomes an increasing problem atop the already increasing number of domestic problems that neither party seems to want to touch. The manifesto seemed a bit wordy when the bulk of the message could be found in the last page - we have two (2) choices, “globalised post-capitalism” or a system of perpetual crisis and utter collapse. In the last couple years of the United States, the younger half of the Millennials, Gen X, and Gen Z have been more proactive in public discussions on revealing political truths and the side effects of ‘white capitalism’ in America. But even with this increased concern and education in comparison to previous generations, its not enough to push the tide to make exponential changes that need to be made in this climate.</p>
